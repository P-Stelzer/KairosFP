Submit a group assignment with the following:
#### 1. Title of the project (5 points):
	a) Students should include a name for the project. If it is an existing project, a GitHub repository information or some reference to the software.

Kairos Financial Planner (KairosFP)


#### 2. Brief description of the problem the software is expected to address (10 points):
	a. There should be a paragraph or a list that describes what the selected software is  supposed to do, such as it is a game that allows multiple players to build a mansion or it enables managing payment over smartphones (these are just examples)

Speaking from experience, someone’s liquid wealth could be scattered among multiple accounts or pools, such as multiple credit cards or gift cards. This fragmentation could easily impede one’s understanding of their financial situation and auspicious planning. The first goal of the app is to clarify what resources a person has at their disposal. This will facilitate informed decisions on how to allocate the money a user has available. This addresses another struggle: prudent spending. Providing tools to project a user’s finances given hypothetical events including expenditures and income. The software will display both past and upcoming events on a calendar and enable convenient additions and modifications and offer other visualizations for items such as  budget utilizations and the user’s spending habits.  The software will allow the user to tailor the organization of their finances to their needs.
  

#### 3. Why did your group select this project (5 points):
	a. Provide rationale as to why this project was selected. For example, does team member have experience with the software or the domain (this is just an example, provide your own reasoning)?
 
Peter had developed the concept of a personal finance tracker prior to the beginning of this class. Upon consulting with group members, the focus shifted to a calendar-based planning application as we all felt like it was something that would be more widely used. After also talking about the project’s concept with people outside of the group, we heard valid concerns people have about the difficulties of managing personal finances. Some of these included keeping track of multiple bank accounts across various banks, managing credit card payments, and recording balances from multiple gift cards. Helping alleviate these problems for customers is the main drive behind this project.


#### 4. The objective of your group (10 points)
	a. The group should clearly indicate their objective, which should be mostly
focused on refactoring the software or in some cases adding new functionality or managing changes or building a new software.

The objective of the group is to build a new software from scratch. This is motivated by a desire to keep track of personal finance, as discussed previously. Our aim for this program is to sufficiently address these concerns and be flexible. Keeping track of these aspects should lead to a better understanding of one’s financial standing and lead to well-informed decisions.

While also having the ability to customize what features the user wants active.
